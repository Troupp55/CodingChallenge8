So in this project it creates a simple event registration portal using HTML and JavaScript. The index.html file contains a form with inputs for the users name, email, event date, and meal preferences. When the user submits the form, the script.js file intercepts the form submission to prevent the page from reloading. It then validates that the fields are all filled out and at least one meal preference is selected. If the validation is successful, the users registration details are displayed on the same page below the form. This is able to happen through manipulation of the DOM using JavaScript.
